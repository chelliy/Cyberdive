# Cyberdive

The project is closed due to the Director's decision.

Cyberdive is a 1-year long thesis project by an IMGD MFA student. I worked as Gameplay Engineer in the team.

Cyberdive is a Roguelite game with minimalistic gameplay where you only need WASD to play through the procedurally generated levels in the treacherous cyber world.

Some bugs still exist in the current build. If you want to replay it, you need to restart it from outside, not in game. The game is based on Perforce.

Contribution: Player skill implementation and Dialogue system integration.
